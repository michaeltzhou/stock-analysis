# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to execute VBA skills that were supposed to be obtained through this module to conduct analysis on a set of environmental stocks to calculate the total volume traded and the return percentage for certain tickers within a given year. This was to be done through refactoring the initial solution code from the module to try and improve the runtime.
## Analysis
### Results
### Summary
Refactoring code requires a reconsideration of the underlying logic that drives the code. This can take up to a significant amount of time and there is no guarantee that the refactored code will run more efficiently than the previous iteration. The amount of saved time is relatively insignificant especially if the initial runtime is quite short, as is the case with smaller datasets. However with larger data, runtime can become longer and required computing power would likely increase. Thus, refactoring in that case would become espeically valuable, as the amount of time saved becomes multiplicatively more significant based on the amount of datasets being run. For example, refactoring a code for analysis could potentially decrease the analysis time of a dataset from two hours to 30 minutes, allowing for more data sets to be analyzed.

Within the scope of this project, refactoring the VBA script definitely condensed the code and decreased the runtime
